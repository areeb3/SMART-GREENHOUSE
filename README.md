# SMART-GREENHOUSE

• An indoor greenhouse powered by Arduino Nano

• A smart Greenhouse controlled in real-time, as the environmental conditions change continuously we need an efficient and smart monitoring.

• Moisture sensor, temperature & humidity sensor, liquid pump in use all controlled by arduino nano

• Regular temperature display 


FUTURE PLANS - 

• Create a dynamic application so that user can monitor the greenhouse remotely
